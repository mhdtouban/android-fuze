# Functional Reactive MVVM Sample for Android™

The project Fuze is an exemple of `MVVM design pattern` in full functional reactive programming `RxJava2, Lambda`, and with dependency injection `Dagger2`, the design pattern makes the app easier to test.
It's based on Kickstarter oss app for Android™ (migrated from RxJava to RxJava2)
